# LabShareDAO Smart Contract

## Overview
LabShareDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Sui blockchain, designed specifically for research laboratories to securely share data, manage IoT devices, and collaborate on research initiatives. The system provides infrastructure for transparent governance, verifiable data records, and automated alert based on sensor data.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DAO Management**
   - Implemented as a shared object on Sui blockchain
   - Member management with voting power
   - Treasury functionality for handling SUI tokens
   - Permission-based access control for administrative functions

2. **Data Registry**
   - Secure storage of research data with cryptographic hashing
   - Verifiable data pipeline for IoT sensor inputs
   - Immutable record-keeping with timestamp verification
   - Metadata storage in structured JSON format

3. **Governance System**
   - On-chain proposal submission and voting
   - Multiple proposal types (General, Alert, Configuration)
   - Time-bound voting periods with quorum requirements
   - Automatic proposal execution based on voting outcomes

4. **IoT Integration**
   - Sensor type registration and configuration
   - Threshold-based alert system
   - Automatic proposal creation for anomalous readings
   - Data verification through hashing

## Smart Contract Details

### Core Objects

1. **DAO**
   - Central shared object that stores all DAO state
   - Contains tables for members, proposals, and data records
   - Manages treasury funds in SUI tokens

2. **Member**
   - Stores member information and voting power
   - Tracks membership history and activity

3. **Proposal**
   - Represents governance proposals with voting mechanics
   - Supports different proposal types and references to data

4. **DataRecord**
   - Immutable record of research or IoT data
   - Includes cryptographic hash for verification
   - Linked to sensor type and submitted by member

5. **ThresholdConfig**
   - Configuration for IoT sensor alert thresholds
   - Defines acceptable ranges for sensor readings

### Key Functions

1. **Membership Management**
   - `add_member`: Add a new member to the DAO
   - `update_member`: Modify member information or voting power
   - `remove_member`: Remove a member from the DAO

2. **Proposal Lifecycle**
   - `create_proposal`: Submit a new proposal
   - `vote`: Cast a vote on a proposal
   - `execute_proposal`: Execute an approved proposal
   - `create_alert_proposal`: Automatically generate proposals from alerts

3. **Data Management**
   - `submit_data`: Record new data with cryptographic verification
   - `configure_sensor`: Set up a new sensor type
   - `set_threshold`: Configure alert thresholds for sensors

4. **Treasury Operations**
   - `deposit`: Add funds to the DAO treasury
   - `withdraw`: Remove funds (requires governance approval)

### Events

The contract emits the following events for off-chain indexing and notification:

1. `MemberAdded`: New member joined the DAO
2. `DataRecordCreated`: New data record submitted
3. `ProposalCreated`: New governance proposal created
4. `VoteCast`: Member voted on a proposal
5. `ProposalExecuted`: Proposal execution completed
6. `AlertTriggered`: Sensor reading exceeded threshold

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions for administrative functions
   - Membership verification for voting and data submission
   - Treasury protection through governance mechanisms

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Cryptographic hashing of research data
   - Immutable record storage on Sui blockchain
   - Verification mechanisms for data provenance

3. **Governance Safeguards**
   - Quorum requirements for proposal approval
   - Time-bound voting periods
   - Transparent voting record

## Technical Implementation

The contract is implemented in Move, Sui's native programming language, leveraging the following Sui features:

1. **Object-Centric Model**
   - Utilizes Sui's object-centric storage for efficient data management
   - Leverages shared objects for collaborative DAO governance

2. **Table Data Structure**
   - Uses Sui's `Table` for efficient key-value storage
   - Maintains relationships between proposals, members, and data

3. **Event System**
   - Emits structured events for off-chain indexing
   - Enables frontend notification system

4. **Transaction Blocks**
   - Batch operations for efficient execution
   - Atomic operations for data consistency
