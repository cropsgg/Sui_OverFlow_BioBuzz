    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation 
    that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. The most common symptoms include 
    dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production. COPD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, leading to a substantial economic and social burden. 
    Early diagnosis and management can improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and slow disease progression. Current therapies include smoking cessation, 
    pharmacologic treatments such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, and oxygen therapy in advanced cases. Patient education about the disease, 
    self-management strategies, and adherence to treatment regimens are crucial for optimal outcomes. Healthcare providers should conduct regular assessments to monitor 
    disease progression and adjust treatment plans accordingly.
